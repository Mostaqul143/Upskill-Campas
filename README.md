# Smart City Traffic Patterns Analysis

Welcome to my Smart City Traffic Patterns Analysis project! This repository contains the analysis of traffic patterns in the city, aiming to improve traffic management and infrastructure planning. The analysis explores various factors influencing traffic patterns and provides insights for better decision-making.

## Features

- Visualizations of traffic patterns by day of the week, month, and hour.
- Comparative analysis of traffic patterns during holidays and regular days.
- Breakdown of traffic patterns by junctions and other relevant features.
- Trends in traffic patterns over time.

## Insights

### Traffic Patterns Analysis:
This repository contains the analysis of traffic patterns in the city, aiming to improve traffic management and infrastructure planning.

### Dataset:
The dataset used for the analysis contains information on various features such as date, hour, and junctions. It also includes the target variable, which is the number of vehicles.

### Analysis Steps:

- **Data Exploration:** Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or manipulate existing features to extract valuable information and improve model performance.
- **Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate the trends and patterns in traffic data, helping stakeholders understand the insights easily.
- **Model Building:** (If applicable) Develop predictive models to forecast traffic patterns and evaluate their performance.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings from the analysis, including insights into peak traffic hours, factors influencing traffic volume, and recommendations for infrastructure improvements.

## Results

Here are the key findings from the analysis:

- Peak traffic hours are observed during weekdays, particularly during morning and evening rush hours.
- Traffic volume varies across different junctions, with some experiencing higher congestion than others.
- Holidays and special occasions have a noticeable impact on traffic patterns, with deviations from regular working days.
